Introduction to Python
In this section of the course, we will focus on the fundamentals of programming with Python programming language. We will explore the syntax and semantics of Python programming language and see useful programming constructs for general programming and for data science.
You are expected to study the Chapters 1,2,3,4 from the course book. These will cover background materials about computers and computer programming (Chapter 1), Python programming (Chapter 2), Control Statements and Program Development (Chapter 3), and functions (Chapter 4).
Your knowledge will be tested with a series of quiz questions that will appear on the course page after you have studied the materials.
